// TODO: document as pattern: if no specific observer is available/responsible, but a specific observation (closure) shall be stopped manually like with a cancellable... anonymous observer doesn't work because that is used by other clients as well and might observe the observable with other closures already that we don't want to stop ... then an adhoc observer itself can serve as a "cancellable" reference to a specific observation. as long as we hold on to it, we can stop the observation ...

public class AdhocObserver: Observer
{
//    init() { print("🥚") }
//    
//    deinit { print("💀") }
    
    public let receiver = Receiver()
}
