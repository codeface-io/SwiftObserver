Thanks for improving SwiftObserver!

The only prerequisite you need, is that you've read about [SwiftObserver's philosophy](https://github.com/flowtoolz/SwiftObserver/blob/master/Documentation/philosophy.md) to get a feeling for the purpose of SwiftObserver.

There's no red tape involved here:

1. Fork the project
2. Create a branch that's meaningfully named by the thing you want to accomplish
3. Implement your idea
4. Make a pull request
